**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
You play as a cargo ship gaurd in VR, protecting your ship from vicious pirates as you travese across the globe!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The game is in VR, and we are printing a custom controller mount that will emulate a gun within the game to make the whole thing feel super realistic. The game style is a fast paces wave defense game.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
You play in a campaign with increasing difficulty, where you will buy upgrades as the rounds go on and enemy boats keep approaching you.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Each level has new types of enemies, progressivley getting harder. The learning curve is incredibly low, and the end goal is simple. By keeping upgrades and unique perks, we keep the player engaged.
